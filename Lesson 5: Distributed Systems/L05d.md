# L05d: Active Networks

=> End to end QoS via Active Networks 

Reference: [David Wetherall, " Active Networks: Vision and Reality: Lessons from a Capsule-based System ", 17th ACM Symposium on Operating System Principles, OS Review, Volume 33, Number 5, Dec. 1999.](https://gatech.instructure.com/courses/297032/files/36092859/download)



### Routing on the Internet

- Router does not inspect the packets
- Router check the destination, determines the next hop based on the routing table and forward the network packets. 
- Making the routing active == Next hop dynamic
  - Customizing routing
  - How do we ensure the code will not break the network?

Option 1: Send individual messages to N siblings

Option 2: Send 1 message, finally at close to the destination, the router at the other end demultiplex and send to N siblings

Option 3: Send 1 message, the router demultiplex the message throughout the Internet



<u>How to implement the vision?</u> 

- The OS should provide **QoS APIs** to the applications, (e.g. the network flow has the real-time constraints because of video data), which can synthesize codes that takes the QoS constraints and put them into executable code that can be passed around as part of the package
- The App passes QoS + Payload, the OS generates the code along with the payload, and pass the destination with a IP header
- If the internet is able to handle it, it will be able to make intelligent routing decisions along the network.

<u>Challenges:</u> 

- Difficult to change the Protocol stack (TCP/IP)

- Network router is not open, we cannot expect that all the network routers are able to execute the code and make intelligent decisions



### ANTS Toolkit (Active Nodes Transfer System)

- Since modifying protocol stack is non trivial, ANTS is an application level package. This toolkit is available for APP level programmer. ANTS toolkit provides a capsule (ANTS Header + Payload)
- Normal Protocol stack picks on the IP Header + Payload (ANTS header + actual payload)
- This capsule will traverse through the network
  - If the router is a normal router, it will simply use the IP header
  - If the node is an active header, it will do the intelligent routing decision. 
- We keep active nodes only at the edge of the network. The rest of the core IP network is unchanged.

### ANTS Capsule and API

<u>ANTS Capsule</u>

- Normal IP header
- ANTS header
  - Version
  - Type - MD5 hash of code
  - Prev - Identity of the upstream node that successfully process the capsule
  - Hdr
- Payload

<u>APIs</u> (very minimal set of APIs)

- Forwarding packets
- Soft store = a place where we can store whatever that is important for customising the network (e.g. code, computed hints for state of capsule)
- Querying the node for state of network

<u>Routers are in the public internet. Executing the code in network needs to be:</u> 

- Easy to program
- Easy to debug, maintain and understand
- Processing should be very quick
